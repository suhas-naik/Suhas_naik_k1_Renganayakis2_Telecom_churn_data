# Approach
Following is the step-by-step approach followed to solve the given problem statement:

Data Understanding
Feature Engineering
Data Visualisation (EDA)
Data Preparation
Model Building
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost Classifier
PCA + Logistic Regression
PCA + Random Forest
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Model Selection, Evaluation and Prediction
Test Data Analysis

# Conclusions
Random Forest and XGBoost resulted in an accuracy of 94.436%
Using PCA was not helpful in improving the accuracy
Logistic regression alone or with PCA was not helpful in achieving good accuracy
